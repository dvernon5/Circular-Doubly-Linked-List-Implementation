# Circular-Doubly-Linked-List-Implementation
## Overview  
Welcome to the Circular Doubly Linked List project! This data structure is a variation of a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular arrangement. Additionally, each node has pointers to both the next and the previous nodes, forming a doubly linked structure. 

### Features  
1. #### Insertion
   1. **Insert at the Beginning** - This function allows you to insert a new node with the specified data at the beginning of the circular doubly linked list. It efficiently updates the pointers to maintain the circular and doubly linked nature of the list.
   2. **Insert at the End** - Inserting at the end adds a new node with the given data to the end of the list. The pointers are appropriately adjusted to preserve the circular and doubly linked properties.
   3. **Insert at a Specific Position** - You can insert a node with the provided data at a specific position in the circular doubly linked list. The position is a positive integer indicating the desired index.

2. #### Deletion
   1. **Delete from the Beginning** - This function removes the node from the beginning of the circular doubly linked list. It updates the pointers accordingly to maintain the circular and doubly linked structure.
   2. **Delete from the End** - Deleting from the end removes the last node in the list. The pointers are adjusted to keep the circular and doubly linked list intact.
   3. **Delete from a Specific Position** - You can delete a node from the circular doubly linked list at a specified position. the position is a positive integer indicating the index of the node to be removed.
  
3. ### Print Circular Doubly Linked List
   1. **Print List** - This function prints the values of the circular doubly linked list in order, starting from the first node and traversing the circular structure.
